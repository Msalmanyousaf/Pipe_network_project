# Pipe Network Project  
In this project, a pipe network with in-flows and out-flows at certain points is given. The task is to compute the flow rate in each pipe/tube using the Fluid Mechanics principles.   

Object-oriented approach is followed in C++ and the complete description of class structure and other project-related information are given in the file "Project_description.pdf".   

"pipedata.txt" containts the information about total number of pipes, nodes (junction of two pipes), flow rate values at the nodes along with their coordinate infomation and the information about the connectivity of pipes along with their diameter.    

Running the "main.cpp" file will read the pipe data, generate the objects of classes (see "pipe_classes.h" and "class_functions_definitions.h") and make an output file "main.exe", which shows the calculated flows in all the pipes.
